## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. You will also need a MongoDB connection string (you can get a free one from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create the environment file for the backend:**
    Inside the `backend` folder, create a new file named `.env` and add the following variables.
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_secret_key_for_jwt
    PORT=8000
    ```

### Running the Application

You'll need two terminals open to run both the frontend and backend servers.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # In your first terminal, from the 'backend' directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:8000.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    ```bash
    # In your second terminal, from the root project directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
